    text: `üéì Formal Education:

Bachelor of Science in Information Technology
St. Dominic College of Asia | August 2022 - 2026 (4th Year - Graduating Student)

As a graduating IT student in my final year, my comprehensive program has provided a solid foundation in:
- Software Development: Object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms
- Database Systems: Design, implementation, and optimization
- Web Technologies: Full-stack development, client-server architecture
- Systems Analysis: Requirements gathering, system design, project management
- Network Fundamentals: Understanding of networking concepts and security
- Mobile Development: Cross-platform application development
- Capstone Project: Currently developing PULSE, a community engagement platform

Senior High School - ICT Track
Informatics Philippines | 2020 - 2022

This specialized track gave me early exposure to:
- Programming fundamentals (started with C++ and Java)
- Web development basics (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Database concepts and basic SQL
- Computer hardware and networking
- Digital literacy and productivity tools

üöÄ Self-Directed Learning Philosophy:
I believe the best learning happens when you build real things. While my formal education provides the theoretical foundation, I learn best by:
- Building projects that solve actual problems
- Experimenting with new technologies through hands-on coding
- Reading documentation and following best practices
- Learning from the developer community and open source projects
- Teaching others what I've learned (which reinforces my own understanding)

üìö Current Learning Focus (2024-2025):
- Python: Data processing, API development, and exploring AI/ML applications
- Laravel: Enterprise-level PHP development and MVC architecture
- Advanced Firebase: Cloud Functions, advanced security rules, performance optimization
- REST API Design: Building scalable, well-documented APIs
- AI Integration: Working with various AI models and building RAG systems
- DevOps Basics: Understanding deployment, CI/CD, and cloud services

üí° Learning Approach:
I don't just follow tutorials - I build variations and improvements. For example, when learning about AI chatbots, I didn't just build a basic chatbot; I created a comprehensive RAG system with security features, logging, and performance optimization. This approach helps me understand not just how to use technologies, but how to apply them thoughtfully to real-world problems.`,

    text: `üåü Personal Interests & What Drives Me:

Physical Activities & Wellness:
I believe in maintaining a healthy balance between coding and physical activity. I enjoy going to the gym regularly, which helps me stay focused and energized for programming challenges. I also love jogging and running - there's something about the rhythm that helps me think through complex problems. Walking is another favorite activity of mine, especially when I need to clear my mind or brainstorm new project ideas.

Sports Background:
I used to play basketball actively, which taught me valuable lessons about teamwork, strategy, and perseverance - skills that translate well into software development and project collaboration.

Entertainment & Relaxation:
When I'm not coding or exercising, I enjoy watching anime and movies. These provide great inspiration for UI/UX design and storytelling in applications. Anime especially has influenced my appreciation for attention to detail and user experience design.

üíª Beyond Coding:
Outside of programming, I'm genuinely curious about how technology can improve people's lives. I enjoy exploring new technologies not just for the sake of learning, but to understand how they can solve real problems. I find myself constantly thinking about user experience - how can we make technology more accessible and helpful?

 Professional Passions:
- AI Integration: I'm fascinated by how AI can enhance web applications without overwhelming users
- Real-time Technologies: There's something magical about building systems where users see changes instantly
- Community-Focused Software: Building applications that bring people together and serve local communities
- Clean Code & Best Practices: I believe good code is not just functional, but readable and maintainable

 Community & Collaboration Values:
I believe in giving back to the tech community. While I'm still early in my career, I try to:
- Share what I learn through code comments and documentation
- Help classmates with programming challenges
- Contribute to discussions in developer communities
- Build projects that others can learn from and build upon

 Creative Problem Solving:
I approach development like solving puzzles. I enjoy the process of breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces. Whether it's figuring out how to optimize a database query or designing a user interface that feels intuitive, I find satisfaction in finding elegant solutions.

 Growth Mindset:
I'm comfortable with not knowing everything - in fact, I think that's what makes this field exciting. Every project teaches me something new. I've learned to embrace challenges as learning opportunities rather than obstacles.

 Work-Life Balance Philosophy:
I believe in sustainable development practices. While I'm passionate about coding, I also understand the importance of stepping away from the screen to gain fresh perspectives. My gym sessions, runs, and entertainment time aren't just hobbies - they're essential for maintaining creativity and problem-solving abilities.

üáµüá≠ Cultural Context:
Being from the Philippines, I understand the importance of building technology that works in diverse environments - from high-speed internet in Manila to slower connections in rural areas. This perspective influences how I think about performance, accessibility, and user experience.`,
